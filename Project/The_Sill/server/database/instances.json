    "commonInfo": "Kalanchoes are succulent plants often grown for their tiny, colourful flowers. The best known are Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, also known as flaming Katy, panda plant or widow’s thrill. They are popular house plants grown for their brightly coloured flowers in shades of red, magenta, yellow, orange and white. ",
    "floweringInfo": "It starts in the last winter weeks and lasts approximately 30 days.",
    "illuminationInfo": "Needs bright, but diffused light, the duration of daylight hours is about 12 hours.",
    "temperatureInfo": "In winter – 14-18 degrees, and in summer – 18-28 degrees. Make sure that the temperature in the room where the flower is located is not less than 10 degrees.",
    "wateringInfo": "Bottom watering is recommended. During the growing season, it should be moderate and carried out immediately after the top layer of the potted substrate has dried. In winter, it is necessary to water the flower only after the soil mixture dries out to 1/3 of the depth.",
    "humidityInfo": "It grows well with the air humidity usual for living rooms. However, on hot days, it is recommended to systematically moisten the flower from a sprayer with lukewarm water.",
    "fertilizerInfo": "In the summer and autumn (during the formation of buds), it is necessary to feed the bush once a week, for this, fertilizer is used for succulent plants and cacti. You can feed the Kalanchoe with organics no more than 1 time in 1 weeks.",
    "restPeriodInfo": "It begins immediately after flowering and lasts approximately 30–45 days.",
    "trimmingInfo": "When the bush fades, all flower stalks are removed.",
    "transferInfo": "This procedure is carried out only when necessary when the root system becomes too crowded in the pot. The flower is transplanted at the beginning of the growing season.",
    "soilMixtureInfo": "To grow a crop, you can use a ready-made soil mixture intended for cacti and succulent plants. A substrate consisting of leafy and soddy soil, sand and peat (2: 4: 1: 1) is also suitable.",
    "reproductionInfo": "By cuttings and seed method.",
    "features": "The Kalanchoe plant is a member of the Fat family. This genus unites more than 200 different species, while it is represented by shrubs, succulents and herbaceous perennials. In nature, this plant can be found in the tropical regions of Asia, Australia and America. Foliage may vary from species to species. As a rule, the leaves are thick, they are sessile or have petioles, and they can also be weakly or strongly dissected. During flowering, an umbrella is formed, which includes flowers of white, purple, red or yellow color. At home, almost all types of this plant grow well, if, of course, the florist adheres to the rules of caring for the crop.",
    "floweringText": "In order for the Kalanchoe to please you with lush flowering, the duration of daylight hours in spring and summer should be no more than 10-12 hours. However, the lighting must be very bright. In some species, flowers can be cut and placed in a vase of water, where they can stand for a relatively long time. After flowering is over, some of the shoots can be cut off to form a neat bush. If necessary, the cut stems can be rooted.",
    "illumination": "When cultivated in indoor conditions, the optimal length of daylight hours for Kalanchoe is about 12 hours. In this regard, in the warm season for its cultivation, it is recommended to choose window sills of western or eastern orientation. In winter, it is recommended to rearrange the bush to the south window. If in the cold season the daylight hours are not long enough, then the flower will need to be supplemented, for this additional artificial lighting is used.",
    "temperature": "Kalanchoe can grow well at almost any air temperature. But you should not go to extremes! In summer, temperatures can vary from 18 to 28 degrees, and in winter – from 14 to 18 degrees. If the temperature in the room drops to 10 degrees (and below), then the plant can get sick and die. During cold wintering (14-18 degrees) flower buds are laid.",
    "watering": "For irrigation, use warm, soft and well-settled water. Watering is carried out after the top layer of the soil mixture dries out, but make sure that the earthen coma does not dry out, as this provokes massive flying around the foliage. In winter, watering is carried out after three or four days have passed after the soil mixture has dried. Experts advise to water the flower through the pallet.",
    "humidity": "The culture does not need spraying, because it grows well with air humidity normal for living rooms. However, it responds well to humidification from a spray bottle on hot days. But if you do not spray it in the heat, then nothing terrible will happen. The leaf plates of such a plant are fleshy, sometimes there is pubescence on their surface, so the moisture evaporates very slowly.",
    "fertilizer": "It is necessary to feed the bush only in the summer, and even in the autumn, when its buds are forming. To do this, you can use special fertilizers for cacti. In summer, Kalanchoe is fed with organic matter twice a month, and mineral fertilizers – once every 1 days.",
    "restPeriod": "Move the kalanchoe to a cool, brightly lit room for six weeks. Keep the temperature around 50 to 65 degrees F. Give it bright light for 10 hours each day. Move it to a completely dark room or closet for the other 14 hours of the day.",
    "trimming": "Since most of the Kalanchoe species discard old leaf plates, such shoots can, if desired, be cut off and planted in the same or in an individual container. And in other species, the stems may fall over the edge of the planting container, in this case you can also cut them off and plant next to them, but you can not touch them.",
    "transplant": "Kalanchoe is transplanted only when it grows strongly and it becomes cramped in the pot. At the bottom of the planting tank, a good drainage layer must be made from small pieces of brick or expanded clay. This will avoid stagnation of water in the substrate. For transplanting young bushes, a soil mixture is suitable, which includes peat, sand, deciduous and sod soil in a ratio of 1: 1: 2: 4. If you wish, you can buy a ready-made substrate for succulents in the store. When transplanting an epiphytic Kalanchoe into the soil mixture, it is recommended to pour a small amount of humus.",
    "propagation": "As a cutting, you can use both a leaf plate and a piece of shoot. It is very easy to root them. For example, in the first summer weeks, tear off a leaf from the parent bush and plant it in a fertile soil mixture. Then it is covered with a jar and periodically moistened with a sprayer. After a short time, roots form on the leaf. Also, the culture is quite easy to propagate by seed. They are sown in the last winter or first spring weeks. To do this, take a container, which is filled with deciduous soil. Then, on its surface, it is necessary to evenly distribute the seeds, which are then pressed into the substrate with a finger, and you do not need to fill them with soil mixture on top. The container must be covered with glass and a paper sheet; crops need regular ventilation in the morning and evening. They need to ensure the correct temperature regime from 16 to 20 degrees, as well as timely watering with lukewarm water, while making sure that it does not completely dry out. After the shoots appear, the shelter must be removed from the container. When they are 20-30 days old, they should be unpacked into a larger container. Once again, the plant is transplanted after they have formed the third or fourth true leaf plate. Do not forget to make a good drainage layer at the bottom of the pots, and a substrate consisting of turf soil, peat and sand (2: 4: 1) is used for planting seedlings. After the transplanted seedlings take root well, they should pinch the top, thanks to this, the bush will be more lush and branched. The next transplant is carried out only after the plant becomes cramped in the pot. This time, a soil mixture is used, which includes humus, compost, sand and deciduous soil. The first time a young bush will bloom the next year.",
    "insects": "Mealybugs, scale insects, spider mites, aphids.",
    "problems": "Common diseases with Kalanchoe are root, crown or heart rot, sun-scald, soft rot, scabs, nematodes, leaf-spot disease and powdery mildew.",

    "commonInfo": "Yucca plants are stylish, versatile and low maintenance. They require very little in regards to care, making it a great starter plant for an indoor plant newbie. What more could you want?",
    "floweringInfo": "Mid-summer, early fall (rarely flowers indoors)",
    "illuminationInfo": "Yucca plants thrive in bright, indirect light indoors. Growing yucca in too little light can result in thinner and slower growth, while intense, direct sunlight can cause white spots on leaves or crispy, brown tips.",
    "temperatureInfo": "Yucca plants are adapted to the desert, where temperatures can soar above 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and down to 30 degrees Fahrenheit at night. Therefore, yuccas are relatively adaptable to most indoor temperature conditions and fluctuations. ",
    "wateringInfo": "Yuccas are highly sensitive to overwatering. Water your plant once a week during the spring and summer growing seasons, but ensure it has excellent drainage and dries out between waterings. Come winter, decrease your watering cadence to once every few weeks (or even less). Never let a yucca plant sit in a tray of water.",
    "humidityInfo": "They will grow best with moderate humidity, but as desert plants, they are perfectly content in dry conditions, and there is never any need to mist this plant.",
    "fertilizerInfo": "Fertilize your indoor yucca plant during the growing season with liquid fertilizer or controlled-release fertilizer according to label instructions. A once-a-month feeding is usually sufficient.",
    "restPeriodInfo": "Plants go dormant in winter and require half the water as in summer. When pups appear, divide them away from the mother and repot them alone. Move indoor plants outside in summer and back inside for winter.",
    "trimmingInfo": "Yucca plants need very little in regards to pruning, just go about any general maintenance by taking off any damaged or dead stems, canes, and spears to keep the plant healthy.",
    "transferInfo": "It's not essential, but a good rule of thumb is to repot every two years in Spring. The plants tend to become top heavy as most of the weight is centered at the top of the Yucca, planting in a deep heavy container will help prevent the plant from tipping over.",
    "soilMixtureInfo": "Yucca plants naturally grow in sandy terrain. Inside, plant your yucca in a loose, well-drained potting mix. Low-maintenance yuccas do not need specially formulated or rich fancy soil. Instead, get an inexpensive potting mix and mix in coarse sand and perlite to promote drainage.",
    "reproductionInfo": "There is a more complicated method of taking Yucca root cane cuttings, however as we haven't done this ourselves we can't with good faith recommend it. The easier method is to remove the offsets that are produced from the trunk and pot them up.\n\nChances of the offsets growing will increase if you use a rooting hormone. Water well when first potting up, and then only again when the top inch of the soil has dried out, constantly moist conditions will encourage rot. The offsets should not be fed and should be kept out of direct sunlight until established.",
    "features": "When you need a houseplant with height to add to indoor plant groupings, a spineless yucca plant may be just the thing you’re looking for. These tough-as-nails specimens are normally potted in groupings of three to five canes that are topped with blue-green foliage for a palm tree-like effect, but without the drama. Also called stick yuccas or yucca cane plants, they thrive in average indoor growing conditions, with few pest problems.",
    "floweringText": "A Yucca may produce flowers sometimes, although this is rare indoors. This plant is grown for its leaves and structural height rather than the flowers. However if conditions are good, after a number of years, similar sweet smelling white bell flowers you see on outdoor Yucca's may appear.",
    "illumination": "The Yucca plant is one garden and houseplant which will be quite happy with as much sun as you can give it. Indoors a South facing window would be the first choice. Whatever your light situation try to provide as much as possible.\n\nLess bright conditions will slow growth considerably (which may be an advantage) however very shady and dark spots must be avoided to maintain a healthy looking plant.",
    "temperature": "Yucca Plants grow best indoors when they are kept at a constant temperature. Frequent temperature fluctuations will make it difficult for the plant to acclimatise to the location, so choose an area without drafts and central heating..\n\nHumidity wise, the Yucca Plant likes warm, dry conditions with plenty of ventilation, so it isn’t necessary for the leaves to be spritzed like a lot of other indoor plants.",
    "watering": "Water your Yucca liberally during warmer months of the year. Like all plants it's impossible to give rigid watering intervals, but if conditions are exceptional (bright, warm etc) you could be looking to do this as frequently as once a week or more. The soil should dry out a little between watering's. In Winter a lot less water is required.",
    "humidity": "Moderate humidity will be helpful, however misting of the leaves isn't needed.",
    "fertilizer": "A feed once a month or so would be appreciated during the growing seasons.",
    "restPeriod": "Plants go dormant in winter and require half the water as in summer. When pups appear, divide them away from the mother and repot them alone. Move indoor plants outside in summer and back inside for winter.",
    "trimming": "Indoors, yucca plants occasionally need to be pruned when they grow too tall for your space. However, doing so is a bit unconventional, especially if you're used to pruning traditional landscape plants. Cut back in early spring.\n\nTo prune, remove the plant gently from its pot and use a saw or sharp pair of loppers to cut the trunk in half. Repot the rooted end of the trunk and water it well, continuing to care for the plant as you traditionally would. In just a few weeks, the plant should start producing new leaves, eventually appearing much as it did before, just shorter. You can also plant the top portion of the yucca to try to propagate a second plant.",
    "transplant": "If you think it’s time to repot your Yucca Plant, make sure to choose a pot that is only just slightly bigger than the root ball. Avoid planting in a pot that’s too big as the plant may find it hard to use all the water in the compost.\n\nUse a general potting soil with a mixture of sand and pebbles for good drainage. Remove the Yucca Plant from its current pot, add compost to the bottom of the new pot, and place the root ball in. Fill in any gaps with the rest of the compost.\n\nTop Tip: Yucca Plants prefer to be slightly rootbound in smaller pots so only repot every few years.",
    "propagation": "Your Yucca Plants may start to produce little off shoots known as “pups”. These can be cut away from the mother plant and potted up as brand new little plants.\n\nWait until the pups have turned green and are big enough to survive on their own. Carefully slice them off the main stem with a sharp, sterilised knife and either stand in water until new roots start to appear or plant in compost dipped in rooting hormone.\n\nCarefully slice the pups away from the main stem of the plant and plant up into a new pot. Rooting hormone can be used to make this process quicker and easier.",
    "insects": "The leaves of Yucca Cane are prone to pests like armored scale insects, mealybugs, soft scale insects, and thrips. These pests suck out plant juices. To eliminate these insects, use a forceful spray of water or spray them with horticultural oil sprays or insecticidal soap.",
    "problems": "If the leaves of your Yucca Cane plant are turning yellow, this means it has been exposed to direct sunlight for too long.  If the tips of your Yucca Cane is turning brown, this means that the plant's soil is incredibly dry. However, if the leaves are turning yellow, this means you are overwatering the plant. If your Yucca Cane plant is starting to wilt and die, but it's not because of light or water problems.",

    "floweringInfo": "It starts in spring and ends in late autumn.",
    "illuminationInfo": "Shed some (indirect) light. Fuchsias make easy indoor plants, if you can provide the bright light they need to grow. Place your fuchsia plant near a window, where it'll get filtered sunlight. Moving your plant outdoors for the summer will really help it to thrive. Just keep it in a shady spot and be sure to bring it back inside when the temperature drops below 45°F/7°C at night. Fuchsias won't tolerate frost.",
    "temperatureInfo": "During the growing season from 18 to 24 degrees, and in winter – from 5 to 10 degrees.",
    "wateringInfo": "In March-September, the bush is watered immediately after the top layer of the substrate dries out, and since the last days of November this is rarely done, but care must be taken that the clod of earth in the pot does not dry out completely.",

    "reproductionInfo": "By cuttings and seed method.",
    "features": "The fuchsia plant (Fuchsia) is a member of the Fireweed family. This genus unites about 100 species. This plant was named after Fuchs, who was a German botanist. In nature, fuchsia can be found in Central and South America. Such a plant is represented by small shrubs and trees. In some species, foliage is opposite, while in others it grows in whorls. At the end of the growing season, in some of the species, all the foliage flies around. The shape of the leaf plates is elongated-oval, lanceolate or ovoid, and their edge can be with small notches or whole. The elongated tubular calyxes of flowers with long stamens can be red or white. Both an experienced florist and a beginner can grow fuchsia, because caring for it will not be difficult. It can be grown as a standard tree, as well as an ampelous plant. If you decide to start growing it, then you should immediately take into account that in winter it must be in a cool place, and you also need to remember that all the foliage flies from a faded bush.",
    "floweringText": "If you take proper care of fuchsia grown at home, it will bloom for a very long time, or rather, from May to November, and it will also be able to give juicy berry-like fruits. In order for the bush to form young buds more actively, it is necessary to cut off the wilted flowers in a timely manner. To extend flowering until December, in July the bush must be rearranged on the balcony, and during the summer period it must be cut 3 times.",
    "illumination": "Western or eastern windows are best suited for growing fuchsia, because it needs a lot of bright light, but it must be diffused. In the morning and in the evening, she calmly withstands the direct rays of the sun. When growing a flower on a south-facing windowsill, so that burns do not appear on it, it must be protected from direct sunlight with translucent paper or cloth. If you choose a northern windowsill for growing fuchsia, then it will not have enough light, which will lead to stretching of the branches, and will also have an extremely negative effect on flowering (it will not be at all or it will be scarce). During flowering, the bush should not be disturbed (rearranged or turned), otherwise all the buds, flowers and foliage can fly around it. In the warm season, the bush can be rearranged to fresh air, but it is necessary to accustom it to new conditions gradually.",
    "temperature": "During the growing season, the air temperature should be 18-24 degrees. For wintering, you need to choose a well-lit and cool place (5-10 degrees). It should be remembered that the plant must necessarily winter in the cool. In a warmer place, all the foliage flies from the bush, and the stems become elongated. Fuchsia needs regular ventilation, but it must be protected from drafts, as they can cause her death. In the warm season, the bush can be transferred to the balcony, while for it you should choose a place that will be protected from direct sunlight, drafts and precipitation.",
    "watering": "For irrigation, use well-settled soft water at room temperature. In March-September, watering is carried out immediately after the top layer of the substrate dries out, the fact is that at this time the soil mixture in the pot should be a little damp all the time. From the first days of October, it is necessary to begin to gradually reduce watering, while by the last days of November, watering should become very rare and scarce, thanks to this, the flowering will be more magnificent in the next season. If in winter the flower is in a cool place (less than 10 degrees), then watering is carried out extremely rarely, and if at this time it is warmer than 10 degrees in the room, then the frequency of watering should be slightly increased.",
    "humidity": "For spraying, soft water is used, while it must be well settled (at least 24 hours). In May – August, spraying should be done twice a day (early in the morning (before 9 am) and late in the evening (after 18 pm)). In winter, it is not necessary to moisten the bush from the sprayer.",
    "fertilizer": "Top dressing of such a flower is carried out in April – September 1 time in 15–20 days, for this they use a complex mineral fertilizer for indoor plants. Fuchsia is not fed in winter.",
    "restPeriod": "Fuchsias go dormant in winter. Keep your plant in a cool place (with a minimum of 45°F/7°C). Cut back on watering during this time, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.",
    "trimming": "If such a plant is at room temperature in winter, then because of this, the foliage may fall off, and the stems will become elongated. Since the formation of flower buds is observed mostly on young stems, in order for the flowering to be more lush, old naked shoots must be removed (if desired, they can be used as cuttings). Pruning and pinching of the bush is carried out during the entire growing season. After 3 pairs of true leaf plates grow on young shoots, they need to be pinched. To form a tree, it is necessary to tie 1 of the vertically growing stems to a support, which is also placed vertically. All lateral stems should be cut regularly until the trunk reaches the desired height. Then you need to cut off the top of the tree and allow several lateral stems (from 3 to 5) to grow, of which the crown will consist. A spectacular dense crown of such a tree will form after 3 years.",
    "transplant": "This flower is transplanted once a year in the first spring weeks. Before replanting the bush, its old stems must be shortened by at least 1/1, and the root system is also slightly trimmed. If fuchsia is cultivated as an ampelous plant, then its stems do not need to be cut, otherwise it will become less effective. For transplantation, a slightly acidic substrate is used, which includes peat, deciduous soil and sand (3: 2: 3). You can also use another substrate, consisting of sand, greenhouse and clay-sod land (1: 1: 2), and even a small amount of peat chips. First, a drainage layer must be made at the bottom of the pot, which should occupy 1/5 of the container. The transplanted bush needs to be very well moistened from a sprayer, and also watered abundantly, then it is transferred to a place where the light is bright, but diffused. In the middle of the summer period, if desired, you can carry out a second transplant, while using a fresh soil mixture.",
    "propagation": "To collect seeds from indoor fuchsia, its flowers will need artificial pollination. If there is a desire to get a new hybrid, then during pollination it is necessary to use different types of fuchsia, which differ from each other in color and shape of flowers.",
    "insects": "Spider mites and whiteflies.",
    "problems": "Rot and spots. The plant may become less effective due to violations of the rules of care or improper maintenance. Fuchsia reacts extremely negatively to stagnant air, therefore, during the growing season, the room where the flower is located must be systematically ventilated, or the pot with the plant can be transferred to the balcony.",

    "commonInfo": "Scindapsus pictus usually goes by the common names of Satin Pothos or Silver Vine. It has beautiful firm matte green leaves covered in slightly reflective silver blotches that shimmer and catch your eye in the right light. The leaf edges are outlined in a thin line of silver too. Gorgeous.",
    "floweringInfo": "Although it is a flowering plant, Satin pothos will rarely bloom in cultivation as a houseplant. However, when it does, it exhibits tiny, inconspicuous flowers throughout the summer months.",
    "illuminationInfo": "Bright, indirect light. Quite tolerant to lower light, but can start to lose its characteristic leaf markings.",
    "temperatureInfo": "65-85°F (18-29°C) for best growth.",
    "wateringInfo": "Water once the top 2-3 inches of soil is dry. Will tolerate underwatering, but much less tolerant of overwatering.",
    "humidityInfo": ">40% humidity. Consider getting a digital hygrometer to monitor humidity if your plant is getting brown tips.",
    "fertilizerInfo": "Balanced, water-soluble fertilizer applied monthly through the growing season. ",
    "restPeriodInfo": "Like many tropicals the Scindapsus satin pothos has no season of rest and grows year-round. It is always attractive, but do not expect to see any flowers. It is a fine plant for a warm living room with indirect light or grown in a hanging basket.",
    "trimmingInfo": "Only necessary to control size and shape of your plant.",
    "transferInfo": "Repot in spring when the plant outgrows its pot. Use a pot only 1-2 inches bigger, because a much larger container will hold too much water. It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes. If you want to use a cachepot (decorative container without drainage holes), slip a plain nursery pot in the cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water.",
    "soilMixtureInfo": "Choose a nutrient-rich, well-draining potting mix. Any good quality houseplant potting mix will be suitable.",
    "reproductionInfo": "Propagate stem cuttings in water or moist potting mix.",
    "features": "With silvery dots and splashes against its dark green foliage, the satin pothos (Scindapsus pictus) is sure to grab attention wherever placed in your home. When properly cared for Satin Pothos is a hardy and relatively maintenance-free plant. Let’s start with a short summary of satin pothos care requirements. ",
    "floweringText": "Although it is a flowering plant, Satin pothos will rarely bloom in cultivation as a houseplant. However, when it does, it exhibits tiny, inconspicuous flowers throughout the summer months.",
    "illumination": "Satin pothos (Scindapsus pictus) needs bright light but it must be indirect. When exposed to full direct sun, its leaves will lose their variegation and get scorched.\n\nIf you place the plant near a window with direct sunlight, it will require a curtain to protect it from direct sunlight. ",
    "temperature": "Satin pothos is a tropical plant, which means it needs warmth and humidity. The ideal growth temperature ranges from 65 to 85 degrees F. At a lower temperature, it will suffer cold damage and die. In dry air, the leaf tips can turn brown. ",
    "watering": "When watering satin pothos, the key is to avoid overwatering, which will manifest itself by yellow leaves and the vine wilting.\n\nWater only when the top two inches of the soil feel dry to the touch—poke your finger into the soil to check. Water slowly and deeply with room-temperature water until you see water seeping out of the drain holes. ",
    "humidity": "40 to 50% relative humidity around your plant is ideal. You can increase the humidity by placing the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water, but in a way that the roots are not exposed to the water.\n\nMisting Scindapsus pictus to increase humidity is not recommended because the aerial roots also absorb moisture so it might result in overwatering. ",
    "fertilizer": "During the growing season, from spring to fall, fertilize the satin pothos about once a month with a complete, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer. ",
    "restPeriod": "Like many tropicals the Scindapsus satin pothos has no season of rest and grows year-round. It is always attractive, but do not expect to see any flowers. It is a fine plant for a warm living room with indirect light or grown in a hanging basket.",
    "trimming": "You'll always want to cut the vine ¼ inch (about 2/3 cm.) above each leaf. The point where the leaf meets the vine is called a node, and your pothos will send out a new vine in that area after you've pruned. Take care not to leave any leafless vines.",
    "transplant": "If you see roots emerging from the drainage holes of the pot, it’s time for repotting. Depending on how fast your Scindapsus pictus grows, this might be necessary every year or two years.\n\nRepotting should be done when the growing season starts. Select a pot about one to two inches larger than the current pot and fill it with a fresh indoor potting soil mix. Commercial mixes usually contain enough fertilizer for several months so take that into consideration when feeding the plant. ",
    "propagation": "In the spring or early summer, take four-inch tip cuttings from a healthy plant. Place them in a four-inch pot filled with fresh indoor potting soil mix and good drainage. Keep the soil evenly moist and in the same indirect light location as the mother plant. After about a month, new growth should indicate that the plant has rooted, and you can switch to a more infrequent watering schedule.",
    "insects": "Prone to root rot if overwatered. Spider mites and scale can occasionally be encountered.",
    "problems": "Satin pothos is mostly free of pests and diseases but might be attacked by scales or spider mites, which can be simply washed off. Don’t forget to also rinse the underside of the leaves. Or, if there is a significant infestation, apply insecticidal soap or horticultural oil that is labeled for use on indoor plants.\n\nIf satin pothos receives too much water, it can develop root rot.",

    "commonInfo": "The Myrtle is a distinctive small evergreen shrub or tree native to North Africa and the Mediterranean. This means that it does not thrive relatively well-grown outdoors in the UK and other colder areas. However, they make great indoor plants due to their aromatic white blossom that provides a welcome addition to any house and other benefits.",
    "floweringInfo": "In the first half of the summer period.",
    "illuminationInfo": "The light should be bright but diffused.",
    "temperatureInfo": "In the spring-summer period – from 18 to 20 degrees, and in winter the room should not be warmer than 10 degrees, but it is better if it is about 5 degrees.",
    "wateringInfo": "From spring to autumn, the plant must be watered abundantly immediately after the top layer of the soil mixture in the container dries out. During cold wintering, watering should be very scanty and rare, but complete drying of the earthen coma should not be allowed.",
    "humidityInfo": "Throughout the growing season, systematically moisten the bush from a sprayer with lukewarm water. It is not necessary to spray it in winter.",
    "fertilizerInfo": "In the spring-summer period, myrtle is regularly fed once every 1 days, for this they use a complex mineral fertilizer. There is no need to feed him in winter.",
    "restPeriodInfo": "Observed in winter. If the bush is in the northern part of the room, then the duration of the dormant period will be about 3 months, and when placed in the southern part of the apartment, its duration will be about 6 weeks.",
    "trimmingInfo": "Formative pruning is carried out every year at the beginning of the growing season.",

    "soilMixtureInfo": "Sand, peat, clay, sod and humus soil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2: 2. And for planting, you can use a substrate consisting of sand, peat, humus and sod soil, while all components are taken in equal proportions.",
    "reproductionInfo": "By cuttings and seed method.",
    "features": "The genus myrtle (Myrtus) is a member of the Myrtle family and unites approximately 20 to 40 species. In the wild, myrtle can be found on almost all continents, namely: in the USA in the state of Florida, in Europe off the Mediterranean coast, in West Africa and in North America. This genus is represented by low evergreen trees or shrubs. Solid opposite leaf plates leathery to the touch. The flowers grow from the axils of the leaves, they are collected in short racemose inflorescences, they can be part of the bundles or grow alone. Such a plant is very popular among flower growers, and it is also used in medicine and perfumery – essential oil is extracted from stems and foliage. If you take care of myrtle correctly, it will grow for a very long time at home. It is also interesting that the culture has a phytoncidal effect.",
    "floweringText": "Myrtle's cute summer blooming usually lasts from June to October, releasing a delicate fragrance. Each flower has wispy stamens jutting out from 5-6 pearly white petals (violet, more rarely).",
    "illumination": "Due to the fact that myrtle needs a large amount of bright light, which must be necessarily diffused, it is recommended to grow it on the western or eastern windowsill. If it grows on a north-facing window, then its flowering will be more scarce. And if it is placed on the southern windowsill, then in the warm season the bush will have to be shaded from direct sunlight. In the summer, the flower can be moved outside, while he needs to choose a place that will be protected from the midday burning rays of the sun. Myrtle is taught to bright light gradually.",
    "temperature": "During the spring-summer period, the bush must be kept in a cool place (from 18 to 20 degrees), because the culture reacts negatively to heat. In winter, the myrtle is placed in a cold place (no higher than 10 degrees), while the plant feels best at this time at a temperature of about 5 degrees. In the event that during the winter the bush is warm (above 10 degrees), all its leaves may fall off. The room where the flower stands must be systematically ventilated.",
    "watering": "For irrigation, use extremely soft water, and it must also be well settled (at least 24 hours). In spring, summer and autumn, the culture needs abundant watering, which is carried out as soon as the top layer of the substrate dries out. During cold wintering, watering should be reduced, but make sure that the lump of earth in the pot does not dry out in any case. Also, make sure that no liquid stagnates in the soil mixture. In the event that the earthen lump is still dry, the container along with the bush is immersed in a container with water.",
    "humidity": "The culture needs increased air humidity, in this regard, in the spring, summer and autumn, the bush is systematically moistened from a spray bottle, using well-settled and soft water for this. During cold wintering, it is not necessary to moisten it.",
    "fertilizer": "In the spring-autumn period, the myrtle must be fed regularly; for this, fertilizer for indoor plants is used. The regularity of feeding should be 1 time in 7 days.",
    "restPeriod": "If myrtle grows on the northern windowsill, then the duration of the dormant period will be 3 months. If it is grown on a southern window, then the dormant period will be shorter, or rather, about 6 weeks.",
    "trimming": "The culture needs regular pruning. If the bush is not trimmed at all, then its shape will be pyramidal, when trimming the side shoots, a tree is formed, and if you trim the upper shoots, then the myrtle will have the shape of a bush. Experts do not recommend, very often to cut off the lateral shoots, the fact is that the trunk of the plant is rather weak, and with frequent pinching, the flowering becomes more scarce. When grown indoors, the culture is very fast growing; in just 2 years, a thick and spectacular plant can form from a small bush.",
    "transplant": "Young plants are transplanted systematically every year. And adult specimens are transplanted less often, or rather, once every 1-2 years. During transplanting, do not cover the base of the trunk with soil mixture. Several different substrates can be used for planting and transplanting: sand, humus, clay and sod soil are taken in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2; connect sand, sod, humus and peat soil, which are taken in equal shares; simple greenhouse land. In order to avoid stagnation of liquid in the root system of the plant, make a good drainage layer at the bottom of the pot.",
    "propagation": "Cuttings can be carried out twice a year: in January and in July. For this, semi-lignified cuttings are harvested, the length of which can vary from 50 to 80 mm, more than half of the leaf plates must be cut off, while those that remain are shortened, this will reduce the evaporation of moisture. For better rooting, it is recommended to treat the cut site with an agent that stimulates root growth. For rooting, cuttings are planted in boxes or bowls, which are filled with an earth mixture consisting of leafy soil and coarse sand. The container with cuttings is covered with glass (film), they are removed to a shaded place and they are provided with regular watering and airing. For better rooting, the air temperature is maintained at 18 to 20 degrees. In cuttings, the roots grow after 20-30 days, then they are planted in separate pots, reaching 70 mm in diameter, which are filled with a substrate consisting of peat, turf and humus soil, and also sand (1: 1: 1: 1). To stimulate flowering, myrtle will need abundant watering and a pinch. After the root system of the grown plant becomes very cramped in the pot, it must be transferred to another container, which should be slightly larger than the previous one. The first flowering of a bush that has grown from a cutting is observed after 3 or 4 years.",
    "insects": "The major insect pests of crape myrtles are crape myrtle aphids and primrose flea beetles. A few insects on a plant usually do not cause damage to the plant. However treatment may be necessary to prevent further damage, if an insect population increases.",
    "problems": "Myrtle leaves turn yellow, fall off and curl… If the myrtle lacks light, then its shoots become elongated, and the foliage grows faded and small. If the lighting is too bright, then the leaf plates will lose their shine, turn yellow and curl. The foliage can fly around if the plant is in a room that is too warm and poorly lit. Myrtle leaves fall… If the earthen lump in the pot dries up completely, then all the foliage can fly from the bush. In this case, cut the stems in half, regularly wet the bush with a sprayer, and increase the watering rate. After about half a month, new foliage will begin to grow.",

    "features": "Nertera is a herbaceous perennial creeping plant that has opposite oval-shaped leaf plates, reaching about 5 mm in diameter. Single flowers can be four- or five-membered, their green corolla is tubular or funnel-shaped. These white flowers are inconspicuous and therefore do not represent any decorative value, they open in late spring or early summer. When the plant has bloomed, after a while, small red (up to 10 mm) berries are formed on it, it is thanks to them that nerter is sometimes called “coral moss”.As a rule, nertera are grown for just one season. Bushes acquire before the formation of fruits on them, and when they fly around, they get rid of the plant. However, if this culture is properly looked after, then it will be able to delight the grower with its unusual appearance for more than one year. There is an assumption that the room nertera helps to increase the energy of the people living in the apartment. And in order to enhance this beneficial effect of nertera on a person, you just need to buy a few bushes.",
    "floweringText": "Its leaves are small, ovular, and dark green while its flowers bloom a white to yellowish-green color. What makes this plant so beautiful, however, are not its flowers but the berries that appear after the blooming period. ",
    "illumination": "Nertera, grown at home, needs bright diffused light. In the warm season (or better from early spring to the formation of fruits), transfer the bush to the street, and for it they choose a place that is protected from direct sunlight, precipitation and drafts. In the autumn-winter period, the plant also needs a lot of light, in this regard, it is recommended to supplement it with fluorescent lamps, which should be located at a distance of about 0.5 m from the bush. In the event that the lighting is too scarce, this will have an extremely negative effect on the decorative qualities of the flower.",
    "temperature": "Best of all, nertera feels cool at home. During the spring-summer period, a temperature of about 20 degrees is recommended for her. And when autumn comes, the temperature is gradually reduced to 12 degrees, and in winter it should be even lower – 10 degrees. From the second half of the autumn period until spring, the room where the flower is located must be systematically ventilated. At the end of winter or early spring, when the air temperature outside will no longer drop below 6 degrees, the plant is transferred to fresh air, and a well-lit place that has reliable protection from drafts is chosen for it. Pay close attention to weather forecasts, as even a slight frost can destroy the flower. The plant is transferred back to the house only after it has faded and fruits begin to form on it.",
    "watering": "During the growing season, the plant needs systematic watering, which is carried out immediately after two days have passed since the top layer of the soil mixture in the pot dries out. In winter, the amount and abundance of watering is reduced, but only if the plant is in a cool (about 10 degrees) place. When the first new leaf plates grow on the bush in spring, they begin to water it according to the scheme that is used in the warm season (see above).",
    "humidity": "During the period of active growth of the plant, it is systematically moistened from a spray bottle; for this, boiled or well-settled water is used, the temperature of which should be close to room temperature. Regular spraying of the plant is carried out until the beginning of flowering, please note that water droplets should not fall on the surface of flowers and fruits. In order to increase the level of air humidity, wet pebbles, peat or expanded clay are poured into the pallet, and then a container with a plant is placed on it. The bottom of the pot should never come into contact with the water in the pan.",
    "fertilizer": "Fertilizing a flower is carried out systematically once every 30 days, using a complex mineral fertilizer for this. Fertilizers are applied to the substrate only during the period of active growth of nertera.",
    "restPeriod": "When warm winter nertera does not go into a rest period, because of what is pulled, it expands and becomes bare.",
    "trimming": "If you notice any wilted leaves, you can absolutely trim them off to keep a healthy appearance. This will also divert any water from being sent to dead leaves. The same goes for any shriveled or black fruits that appear on the Coral Bead. \n\nBlack fruits may signal that there is an infection so it is important to inspect the plant fully if any are spotted. You want to make sure you find the problem before it worsens and ruins your entire plant. ",
    "transplant": "The overwintered bush is transplanted in early spring, and you need to be in time before the flowers open on it. The planting capacity is wide and low. A suitable soil mixture should be loose, and its optimal composition: peat, sand, humus, sod and leafy soil (taken in equal parts). A good drainage layer must be made at the bottom of the container, and the soil mixture cannot be tamped after planting.",
    "propagation": "Nertera can be propagated by seeds, which are sown during the last winter weeks. To do this, use a wide bowl, which is filled with a substrate consisting of peat, sand and leafy soil (1: 1: 1), and a drainage layer must be made at its bottom. Spread the seeds evenly on the surface of the soil mixture (try not to thicken the crops), sprinkle them on top with a thin layer of substrate, which is slightly compacted. Moisten the crops from a spray bottle and cover them on top with a film (glass). Then they are transferred to a warm (about 22 degrees) place. Seedlings do not appear at the same time, for example, some of them may appear after a month and a half, while others – only after 2. After the seedlings appear, they are transferred to a well-lit place, protected from direct sunlight. In poor lighting, the plant is illuminated with fluorescent lamps. Watering is carried out as the soil mixture dries up. When all the fruits fly from the bush, it can be propagated by dividing the rhizome. The plots are planted in separate containers filled with a soil mixture consisting of peat, sod and leafy soil, as well as coarse sand (taken in equal parts). Do not forget to make a drainage layer at the bottom of the pot from small pieces of brick or expanded clay.",
    "insects": "Most often, mealybugs, spider mites, scale insects and whiteflies settle on such a plant.",
    "problems": "If the nertera is warm during the winter, this will lead to the fact that she will not start a dormant period. The result of this will be flying around all the foliage.",

    "illumination": "Although bright, indirect light is excellent, try to throw in an hour of morning or evening sun, if possible. A short spell in the warmth of the sunlight will bare great benefits for the specimen, as heightened rates of photosynthesis (& therefore water-uptake) will downplay the risk of over-watering. Never situate this species in a dark location due to the species' intolerance to lower light levels and prolonged moisture. If you're worried about its setting being too dark, if a newspaper can be read while having your back towards the light source, you're good to go.",
    "temperature": "In summer: up to 80,6 ° F, in winter, if kept at rest, a temperature of at least 59 ° F is desirable.",
    "watering": "As Hawaiian Palms are indeed succulents and not palms, thanks to the swollen caudex, the ukhouseplants phrase of 'droughts between drenches' must be greatly emphasised. Once around half of the soil dries out, give the plant another proper hydration using lukewarm water to avoid root-stress. If you're unsure as to when the plant needs another drink, feel the pot's weight or dip your finger into the top portion of the potting mix for confirmation. The saying 'little and often' should be avoided at all costs as its soil will prefer periods of dryness. Under-watering symptoms include wilting, little to no growth, and potential foliage shedding. These issues are commonly caused by too much direct sunlight, high ambient temperatures, constricted roots or forgetfulness. Never permit lengthened periods of direct light due to the risk of dehydration and sun-scorch - a common issue throughout the summer months. Over-watering is far more of a problem, with symptoms including yellow lower leaves accompanied by a softened/rotten stem and a loss of leaves. It's always best to under-water a Hawaiian Palm than over-do it, purely based on its impeccable ability to endure short-lived droughts. Root rot is more of an issue during the autumn in winter months, as to suppose to the height of summer.",
    "humidity": "Mist the leaves once or twice a week, all year round, as an under-humid room will cause the foliage to develop browning leaf tips. If frequent misting isn't for you, introduce a humidity tray to provide and maintain a stable level of humidity around the plant. Although a bathroom will boast higher concentrations of airborne moisture, it's highly unreliable due to the constant fluctuations throughout the day, which too can lead to an unhappy specimen.\n\n",
    "fertilizer": "Feed every four waters during the growing period and every six in the autumn and winter, using a 'Houseplant' labelled fertiliser. Never apply a 'Ready to Use’ product into the soil without a pre-water first, as it may burn the roots and lead to yellowed leaves. Symptoms of this include yellowed leaves and stunted growth - both of which can take months to rectify.",

Click here for a detailed step-by-step guide on transplantation, or via this link to learn about repotting with root rot.",
    "propagation": "Via Seed - (Moderate). Despite its succulent body, the only way in which a Hawaiian Palm can be propagated is by artificial pollination during late summer. Some specimens can flower in their first or second year, but it'll depend on the quality of its growing conditions and cultivation. If pollination is successful, the ovules should begin to swell, developing into green berries shortly after. Once they become brown crispy, collect the seed pods and store them in a dry, dark location until the following spring.",

A tropical plant of a Bright green y low maintenance that make it a very interesting option for those lazy in the care of plants at home.",
    "floweringInfo": "Extremely rare in rooms, only in old plants.",
    "illuminationInfo": " Thrives in medium to low indirect light. Can tolerate bright indirect light. Not suited for intense, direct sun.",
    "temperatureInfo": "If you want your Zamioculcas to look its best, keep your room at an even temperature. The best range of temperature for healthy growth is between 18 to 24°C.",
    "wateringInfo": "Water every 2-3 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower light. The only thing that can kill a ZZ plant is overwaterin so if in doubt, water less rather than more.",
    "humidityInfo": "Around 40% relative humidity.",
    "fertilizerInfo": "During the main growing season (April – August), balanced liquid fertilizer.",
    "restPeriodInfo": "From late spring to early autumn the plant can be watered once a week – the rest of the year every 15 to 20 days.",
    "trimmingInfo": "While regular pruning is usually unnecessary for ZZ Plants, there are certain occasions where trimming the plant will benefit it in the long run. Removing diseased or damaged foliage, cutting back leggy growth, and topping longer stems to even out the plant are all good reasons to grab your garden shears.",
    "transferInfo": "Once a year at the beginning of spring, during the first 3 to 5 years",
    "soilMixtureInfo": "To care for your ZZ, you should plant it in a pot containing well-draining potting soil. The best way to create loamy soil for a ZZ plant is to mix a 1-part potting mix with 1-part perlite or horticultural sand. Because ZZs have succulent qualities, cactus potting mix is also an excellent choice to grow this indoor plant.",
    "reproductionInfo": "You can easily propagate a healthy ZZ plant by taking stem cuttings, a leaf cutting, or using the soil-division method.",
    "features": "Indoor plants give life to our houses in large cities and not so large. Having a bit of nature is always nice and more if they are plants that we do not usually see in our environment. For this reason, indoor plants are often tropical or subtropical, since in Spain at least, there would be no other way to grow them and their exotic appeal is indisputable.",
    "floweringText": "Zamioculcas zamiifolia flowering happens every mid-summer to early autumn seasons. However, the flowers are usually not that noticeable because they are hidden at the base of the stems. Its appearance is similar to that of peace lily, a spathe-type flowers that’s white in color. \n\nZZ plant will produce flowers only when it’s already mature. That would take about 5 to 6 years. So, if your ZZ plant is still young, don’t expect to see flowers right away. It’s also rare for indoor ZZ plants to undergo blooming. But that’s totally okay because it’s the leaves that are more sought after. ",
    "illumination": "To care for your Zamioculcas, you need to make sure it gets plenty of light. The best location is near a window if you want your houseplant to grow fast.\n\nIf you decide to put it on a windowsill, make sure it is on an east- west- or north-facing window. Some early morning or late evening sun is fine, but too much direct sunlight during the day can cause leaf burn. On a south-facing windowsill, the plant should be behind sheer curtains.\n\nYour ZZ Plant should be just fine in low-light conditions. Even if it doesn’t get natural sunlight, it will still grow well indoors under artificial light such as in office buildings.",
    "temperature": "The best Zamioculcas zamiifolia temperature range falls between 60-75°F (15-24°C). When planted indoors, the average room temperature is just fine. It’s warm enough for the plant to grow. Besides, indoor temperatures are not as cold as when compared to outside. \n\nYou must know that the temperature tolerance of the ZZ plant does not go beyond 45°F (8°C). It is sensitive to cold temperatures and may incur damage if left cold outside. Bring it inside when there’s a drop in temperature, especially during the night or the winter seasons. \n\nUSDA hardiness zones 9 and 10 offer the perfect climate. If you’re seeking to achieve the best temperature for ZZ plant, areas under this climate are perfect.",
    "watering": "The great thing about having a ZZ plant at home is that you hardly have to water it. The key to knowing when to water a ZZ is when the top layer of the soil is dry. Every week or so, check to see when the top 2.5 cm has dried out.\n\nThe best watering tip to care for your ZZ plant is to thoroughly water the soil until the water drains out the bottom. You can then almost forget about watering for another 2 weeks or so.\n\nThe type of soil you need for a Zanzibar gem plant should be on the dry side. So, don’t let the container sit in a tray of water. This will cause the soil to soak up too much moisture, and you will end up with a ZZ plant that has yellow leaves and stunted growth. The succulent leaves and rhizomes mean that your ZZ can go for longer without water than most other houseplants.",
    "humidity": "Average room humidity is perfect for healthy growth. The only time humidity becomes a concern with a Zamioculcas Zamiifolia is when you’ve got the household heating on in winter. Central heating can dry out the air in your home. During winter, you should mist your houseplants every so often. You will know the leaves need some moisture when their tips turn brown.",
    "fertilizer": "Generally, you don’t need to feed your Zanzibar plant to keep it healthy. The plant is a slow-growing type of houseplant with few nutrient requirements. If you use good-quality potting soil, your plant should get all the nutrients it needs. You can use fertilizer to help boost plant growth during spring and summer. Feed the ZZ plant 4 times a year using a balanced fertilizer for houseplants. Do this after watering. Flushing out the soil helps prevent too many mineral salts from building up which causes leaf burn.",
    "restPeriod": "Plants have a natural\n\"resting period\" during\nthe winter months and\nwill not produce new\nshoots during this time.\nIt's best to hold off the\nfertilizer during this\nperiod. Usually around\nthe middle of March,\nplants will resume\nmaking new shoots.",
    "trimming": "There is no need to prune a healthy plant. Usually, the only time to take the pruning shears to it is to reduce the size of a large plant. In this case, you can prune the stems to the required height. Just remember that pruning doesn’t stimulate faster growth. You should also prune off leaves that have turned yellow. ",
    "transplant": "At some point, your ZZ plant will need repotting. Re-potting in a larger container gives roots more room to grow and helps water drain better. Because your houseplant doesn’t grow fast, you shouldn’t need to repot very often.\n\nThe best time to repot your Zamioculcas plant is in spring when it starts growing. Choose a container with drainage holes that is 5 cm wider than the current one.\n\nGently remove the stems and rhizomes from the pot and shake off excess soil. If you are repotting due to waterlogged soil and root rot, cut off any damaged roots. Fill a new container half full with loamy potting mix. Put your ZZ plant in and fill with the remaining potting mix. Water thoroughly.\n\nPlease note that ZZ plants have very strong roots and oftentimes they will distort or even break open their nursery pots. If you see a strange growth poking out of the soil, it’s just the rhizome saying hi and letting you know that it needs a bigger pot.",
    "propagation": "The use of stem cutting is best for Zamioculcas zamiifolia propagation. This method yields faster results. Choose a large, mature, and healthy stem that you can cut. Chop it into sections having at least 2 inches in length and a few leaves on. Place the cuttings in a jar half-filled with water. Change the water every 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nLeave the cuttings in a bright area, ideally near a windowsill. The cuttings will develop their own roots in time.  The other way to propagate ZZ plant is through leaf cuttings. However, this is a more tedious job so it’s better to use stems instead.",
    "insects": "Root rot is the main concern for ZZ plants, generally encountered by overenthusiastic plant parents. Moisture-laden soil causes the rhizome to decay, and fungal diseases can quickly take over your plant. Usually, any of the common signs of disease, such as yellow leaves, are due to watering issues.",
    "problems": "Yellowing leaves can occur, especially at the base of the stem, if you are over-watering the houseplant. The good news is that the occasional yellow leaf is probably nothing to worry about. As new leaves appear, old ones turn yellow and drop off. If you are caring properly for your Zanzibar gem, the odd yellow leaf is entirely normal.",

The key to successfully growing a Gardenia plant indoors is to try to mimic the outdoor environment as closely as possible. Although it is quite a challenge and an accomplishment to grow a gardenia plant indoors, it is a flowering plant like none other. The jasmine fragrance of the flowers has inspired hundreds of perfumes. Before sending a gardenia plant as a gift, be sure the person you’re sending it to has the time to care for it and the proper environment, otherwise they will just be frustrated as the plant gradually dies.",
    "floweringText": "Gardenia plants will not bloom unless all of their light, water, fertilizer, and soil requirements are met. On top of that, in order for gardenia buds to set, the nighttime temperatures should be around 55°F (12.8°C).",
    "illumination": "Whether you grow your gardenia plant indoors or outside, they all need bright, indirect light. Inside the home, this means near a sunny window but not necessarily sitting on the windowsill itself. A southern-facing room is ideal, with the plant placed somewhere inside the room but not sitting under the burning rays of the sun all day. Most indoor plant lights provide the right amount of light but you may need to experiment with how close the gardenia remains to the light source, moving it closer or further away as need be.\n\nDuring the spring, summer and early fall, a southern window may provide all the light your gardenia needs. In the winter months, many gardenia lovers supplement the natural light in their homes with artificial plant lights to keep their gardenias happy. The lower angle of the sun and shorter days makes even southern-facing natural light limited for the gardenia, and adding another light source helps provide the bright conditions the plant needs to remain healthy.",
    "temperature": "The correct temperature is extremely important. Ideal temperatures for gardenia plants are between 65°-70°F (18.3°-21.2°C) during the day and 55°-65°F (12.8°-18.3°C) at night. Cool night temperatures are essential for the buds to set. Gardenia buds drop off if temperatures go above 70°F (21.1°C).",
    "watering": "While gardenias don't like to be saturated with water, a constant supply of moisture ensures the plant retains it blossoms and remains healthy. To tell if your gardenia needs water, stick your finger into the soil. If it feels dry, water it. If the soil is so soggy it feels squishy, you're watering it too much.",
    "humidity": "The hardest part of gardenia indoor care is keeping the humidity high enough, especially in the wintertime. Those who live in homes with hot air heating know the awful drying effects such a heating system has on the skin and hair of people. On plants, it's even worse. You can buy a hygrometer or a combination thermometer and hygrometer and keep it by your indoor plants to measure the relative humidity and adjust it accordingly. Hygrometers measure humidity, while thermometers measure temperature. Gardenias prefer the relative humidity around 50 to 60 percent.To increase the humidity near your plants, you have several options. First, you can purchase an inexpensive spray bottle and mist plants daily. If that seems like too much work, you can also place the plant on a dish or saucer filled with gravel or pebbles. Add water daily to the pebble tray. As the water evaporates, it will increase the humidity near the plant. A humidifier for your home can increase humidity to comfortable levels throughout the house or room by room, depending on your needs.",
    "fertilizer": "Indoor gardenias need the same or similar fertilizer as their outdoor cousins. Use a fertilizer specially formulated for gardenias. Any fertilizer used for plants that like acidic soil also works well. Use fertilizer according to the label directions.",
    "restPeriod": "In winter it is possible to leave the plant in a cooler place, as there will be no flowering and the plant will be in a kind of rest period. Still maintain a temperature of at least 15 degrees Celsius.",
    "trimming": "Deadhead or remove spent blossoms. Don't be afraid to prune your gardenia as necessary. Pruning encourages healthy new growth and blossoms. For most gardenia varieties, pruning should be done right after the plant is done blooming. If you wait too long to prune, it will not bloom the next year.",
    "transplant": "Indoor gardenias are slow growers and don’t often outgrow their pots. You’ll only need to repot when the roots of the plant are starting to fill the pot and grow out through the drainage holes. If you should need to repot, do so in the late spring as the plant is coming out of its dormant state.",
    "propagation": "Want more beautiful gardenias in your home? These plants can easily be propagated from stem cuttings. During the spring and summer when you prune your gardenia, keep some of the larger clippings to start new little plants. Place each stem in a rooting medium made of half peat moss and half perlite, and water just to moisten.\n\nOnce rooted, plant each stem in its own pot, using the right soil to get the correct pH balance. With care and patience, you’ll soon have more blooming gardenias to display around your home…or to give away as a gift.",
    "insects": "Gardenia plants attract Mealy Bugs, spider mites, white flies, thrips, and Aphids. If using a commercial insecticide or the green solution (recipe in Glossary), avoid spraying the buds or flowers.",
    "problems": "Gardenias can also suffer from powdery mildew, leaf spot, dieback, anthracnose, and sooty mold, some of which can be treated with fungicides. In many instances, however, affected plants will need to be removed and destroyed, making this plant best suited for a gardener who enjoys the challenge of providing just the right conditions to deter most diseases.",

    "commonInfo": "Cyclamen is a group of tuberous perennial hardy deciduous plants that belong to the primrose family. The natural habitat of cyclamen is Syria and Greece. Plants reach a height of 30 cm. Cyclamens are cultivated in greenhouses, gardens, and homes. When growing indoors, it is worth remembering that the optimum temperature is 16 degrees during the day, and 8 at night.",
    "floweringInfo": "The plant blooms very effectively. Flowers are found double and non-double. The flower stalks rise above the foliage, and white, red, pink, or two-colored buds open on them, which makes the cyclamen look like a flock of butterflies during the flowering period.",
    "illuminationInfo": "Prefers shade or partial shade.",
    "temperatureInfo": "4-16 ° C. It is advisable to provide the plant with a cool and humid place.",
    "wateringInfo": "Watering the cyclamen is necessary regularly. But do not overfill when the flower is actively growing or blooming.",
    "humidityInfo": "Another important piece of successful cyclamen plant care is humidity. They like a lot of humidity, and this is especially important during the winter months.\n\nHeating our homes sucks the humidity out of the air. That’s not just bad for our skin, it can be pretty tough on houseplants too.\n\nTo help increase the humidity level around your cyclamen, you can run a humidifier near the plant. You could also try putting it on a pebble tray filled with water (don’t let it to sit in the water though).",
    "fertilizerInfo": "Fertilize  once every two weeks while growing.",
    "restPeriodInfo": "about 2 months after flowering, cyclamen leaves turn yellow and fall off over time. This is how hibernation begins in this plant. Stop watering the plant, let it dry. We hide the tuber in dry peat moss until May. The main thing is to do this before the cold weather sets in.",
    "trimmingInfo": "When your plant has finished flowering, remove yellow leaves and spent flowers. Take special care to remove the stem by pinching and at the same time twisting gently to ensure no damage is done to the core.  ",
    "transferInfo": "Cyclamens, as a rule, should be repotted every two years or so. Depending upon your plant and its container, however, you may have more or less time before it fills up its pot and has to move. When repotting cyclamen plants, it's really best to wait until their dormant period.",
    "soilMixtureInfo": "it is worth picking up a soil consisting of a third of humus and two-thirds of loam. Don’t forget about drainage. Among other things, the soil must be moist and rich in nutrients.",
    "reproductionInfo": "Cyclamen reproduces by seed method. Seeds sprout at different times, so leave gaps between seeds when planting. The planted plants will bloom approximately 16 weeks after planting.",
    "features": "Cyclamen are superb flowering plants. To encourage a plant to continue producing new flower buds, it is important to remove the flowers as soon as they fade. Remove any yellow leaves, as well, to keep the plant attractive and disease free. When removing spent leaves and blooms, it is important to remove the entire flower or leaf stalk, snapping it off cleanly while holding it near the base of the plant. Any part left on the plant could cause it to rot.",
    "floweringText": "Like many other plants in their native eastern Mediterranean climate, cyclamen naturally bloom in the fall, winter, and spring when the weather turns cool and damp. During the hot, dry summers, cyclamen become dormant; their foliage yellows and dies back and plants show no signs of growth. They store energy for the next flowering season in their round tubers.",
    "illumination": "Cyclamen are native to open woodlands. This means that they are adapted to bright but filtered light. Direct exposure to the noonday sun may damage their delicate foliage. They do very well if set next to a window with morning or late afternoon sun.",
    "temperature": "Cool temperatures are essential to extend your plants life about 15 to 18°C during the day, and ideally 12 to 15°C at night. The flowers and leaves will fade quickly in an overheated room.",
    "watering": "Cyclamen are sensitive to overwatering, making them difficult plants to maintain. Soil that is too wet will rot the tuber, while the leaves will wilt and drop and the flower buds will fall off quickly if the soil is too dry.\n Watering the plant directly from the top in the centre of the foliage or keeping the tuber too moist may cause it to rot. It is best to water thoroughly from underneath, by filling the saucer with tepid water and removing any excess water once the soil surface is moist. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, without allowing the plant to wilt. It may be necessary to water the plant from above on occasion to flush accumulated mineral salts from the soil surface, taking care not to water the tuber directly.",
    "humidity": "Keep your plant away from any heat source, to avoid exposing it to higher temperatures and causing it to dry out. You can raise the humidity around the plant by placing the pot on moist gravel, making sure not to allow the pot to stand directly in any water.",
    "fertilizer": "Feed your plant while it is in full growth, i.e. as long as new leaves and new flowers continue to appear, with a balanced fertilizer, such as one labelled 20-20-20, alternating with a fertilizer with a larger amount of potassium, such as one labelled 15-15-30. You can fertilize the plant every other week when you water it. Because the amount of fertilizer to apply depends on the concentration of the product you are using, always follow the directions on the label. Avoid over-fertilizing, especially with a product high in nitrogen, which encourages leaf growth at the expense of flowers.",
    "restPeriod": "The biggest mistake people make with cyclamen care is trying to force them to grow year round. Most people don’t realize that cyclamens need a period of rest, or dormancy, in order to survive.\n\nWhen the plant begins to go dormant, the leaves will start to turn yellow and die, and this is completely normal.",
    "trimming": "Remove wilted or yellowing flowers regularly (deadheading).\nFor that, remove the entire stem that bears the flower, rotating it just a bit in your hand and tugging it off with a sharp pull.\n\nThis twisting and tugging step is required because if a portion of the wilted stem remains, it might rot and make the bulb rot.",
    "transplant": "You should transplant cyclamen into a new substrate about every two years, if the pot becomes too small for the bulb. You should do this at the end of the dormant period before the beginning of active vegetation. But please note that cyclamen does not need a spacious pot, as it blooms well only in small pots, when the layer of the soil between the bulb and the wall of the pot is not more than 0.8-1.2 inches. For example, a pot with a diameter of 2.7-3 inches is suitable for an 1-1.5 years old bulb, and a pot with a diameter of 5.5-6 inches is suitable for a two-three-year bulb. In a new pot, put haydite for drainage, a layer of fresh substrate, then put a bulb with the soil clod and roots and add the substrate so that the tuber is immersed in it by two-thirds. Tamp the soil well. Transplanted cyclamen will need fertilizer not earlier than in a month.",
    "propagation": "If you want to know how to propagate cyclamen, here is information about cyclamen seed propagation. Propagating cyclamen plants by seed involves soaking the seeds and putting them in the ground at the correct time. Generally, you should soak cyclamen seeds in water for up to 24 hours before you put them in the soil. If you want to plant the cyclamen seeds directly outside, do so in the spring. Wait until the soil warms up to 45 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit (7-12 C.). They will bloom the following spring. Alternatively, when you are propagating cyclamen plants by seed, you can start them in pots inside during the winter. This may produce blooms the first year. Cyclamen seed propagation can be slow for florist cyclamen, yet this is the only method used by professional growers. Go ahead and give it a try, but have a lot of patience. You aren’t likely to get mature, full-sized blooming plants before 15 months. Don’t try rooting clippings from the stems or leaves of cyclamen plants. When you are propagating cyclamen plants, you want to use the swollen underground root called the tuber. Cyclamens reproduce via this tuber. You can propagate the plant by lifting the tuber from the soil in the fall and dividing it. Replant the pieces under about 2 inches (5 cm.) of soil to encourage them to root before winter arrives. Adding a layer of mulch protects the tuber divisions from cold weather.\n\nRead more at Gardening.",
    "insects": "The most common cyclamen pests are spider mites and whiteflies. You can get rid of them with insecticides or chemicals.",
    "problems": "Cyclamens aren’t prone to problems, unless you start overwatering them and creating a suitable, wet environment in which fungal pathogens can thrive.\n\nLeaf spots and bacterial rot may affect all parts of the plant and are best prevented by avoiding stagnant water droplets from sitting on the stalks or the leaves of the plant.\n\nThis is part of the reason why cyclamens are best watered from the bottom through the tray of the pot. Apart from pathogens that may awaken in high-humidity conditions, the plant may also get infected by a number of different viral pathogens for which there is no cure – if that happens, you may still attempt to re-grow the plant by carefully washing and replanting its tuber.",
